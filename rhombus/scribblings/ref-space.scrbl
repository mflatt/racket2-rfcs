@title(~tag: "ref-space"){Spaces}

An identifier can have different meanings in different contexts, such as
expression versus binding, because an identifier can be bound in a
specific @deftech{space}. Example spaces include
@rhombus(expr, ~space) and @rhombus(bind, ~space), which
generally correspond to a @tech{namespace} that provides a binding
form for the space.
Binding forms like @rhombus(def), @rhombus(expr.macro), and
@rhombus(bind.macro) bind an identifier in the corresponding space.

Expressions, definitions, and declarations use the same space,
@rhombus(expr, ~space), since those contexts tend to overlap.
Most other contexts have their own spaces, even though some of them also
overlap with expression positions, such as class and interface clauses.
The space for expression is special in another way: a binding in that
space hides any binding for another space in an enclosing scope (but
not bindings in other spaces in the same scope).

The @rhombus(space.enforest) and @rhombus(space.transform)
forms create a new space along with its associated parser
driver and macro-definitions forms.

 Defines @rhombus(space_identifier) as a @tech{space} with syntax
 classes and macro-definition forms that reference and bind in the space
 specified by @rhombus(space_path). The @rhombus(space_path) should be
 globally unique, typically based on the module path of the enclosing
 module, but the intent is that this identifying path is always
 referenced as @rhombus(space_identifier).

 The identifiers bound by @rhombus(option)s are defined and exported
 from @rhombus(space_identifier) as a @tech{namespace}. The identifiers
 bound in @rhombus(meta_option)s are defined and exported from
 @rhombus(meta_namespace_identifier) as a compile-time namespace.

 Normally, the options @rhombus(~syntax_class) and @rhombus(~macro) are
 declared, at a minimum, so that a @tech{syntax class} is defined to
 initiate parsing for the sublanguage, and a macro-definition form exists
 to add bindings that will be used by that parser for the sublanguage.

 The identifier supplied for @rhombus(~syntax_class) is defined as a
 @rhombus(~group) syntax class with a @rhombus(parsed) attribute. The
 syntax class triggers parsing of a group using macros bindings, whcih
 are defined using the identifier bound by @rhombus(~macro) or similar
 options. For a pattern variable using the syntax class bound by
 @rhombus(~syntax_class), its @rhombus(parsed) attribute is the result of
 parsing. No constraints are imposed on the result of parsing, except
 that it must be represented as a syntax object. (If a
 @rhombus(~check_result) option is supplied, then it can impose a check
 on the result for every macro in the sublanguage.)

@itemlist(

 @item{@rhombus(~syntax_class): names an identifier to be bound as a
  @rhombus(~group) syntax class with a @rhombus(parsed) attribute.}

 @item{@rhombus(~syntax_class_prefix_more): names an identifier to be
  bound as a @rhombus(~group) syntax class with @rhombus(parsed) and
  @rhombus(tail) attributes. The given group should start with a prefix
  operator or identifier that is bound for the sublanguage. Parsing
  proceeds as if for the argument of the operator, which means that
  parsing can stop with a tail sequence remaining. The parsed ``argument''
  is returned as the @rhombus(parsed) attribute, while the reminaing tail
  is a @rhombus(tail) attribute.}

 @item{@rhombus(~syntax_class_infix_more): names an identifier like
  @rhombus(~syntax_class_prefix_more), but the syntax class expects a
  group that starts with an infix operator or identifier. Parsing can stop
  when reaching an infix operator in the group whose precedence is weaker
  than the starting one.}

 @item{@rhombus(~macro): names an identifier to be bound to a
  macro-definition form analogous to @rhombus(expr.macro), but for defining
  rule-based macros for the sublanguage.}

 @item{@rhombus(~only_macro): names an identifier like @rhombus(~macro), but
  analogous to @rhombus(expr.only.macro).}

 @item{@rhombus(~macro_result): supplies a compile-time function that is
  applied to two arguments: the result of any macro defined for the
  sublanguage, and a procedure implementing the macro transformer (which
  is useful for reporting errors); the result is a syntax object,
  typically the one that was given, but possibly adjusted.}

 @item{@rhombus(~identifier_transformer): supplies a compile-time
  function that is applied to an identifier that is not bound in the
  sublanguage. By default, a syntax error is reported for unbound
  identifiers.}

 @item{@rhombus(~desc): supplies a string that describes the sublanguage;
   the string is used for reporting syntax errors.}

 @item{@rhombus(~operator_desc): supplies a string that describes
  operators in the sublanguage; the string is used for reporting syntax
  errors.}

 sublanguage that has only prefix-triggered forms, like definition
 contexts.
