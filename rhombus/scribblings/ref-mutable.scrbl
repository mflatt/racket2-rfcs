@doc(
  bind.macro 'mutable $identifier'
){

 Binds @rhombus(identifier) so that its vaue can be changed using
 @rhombus(:=).

 No static information is associated with @rhombus(identifier), even if
 a surrounding binding pattern would otherwise associate static
 information with it.

}

@doc(
  expr.macro '$identifier := $expr'
){

 Changes the value of @rhombus(identifier) to the result of
 @rhombus(expr) and returns @rhombus(#void). The
 @rhombus(identifier) must be bound with @rhombus(mutable, ~bind).

 The @rhombus(:=) operator is also recognized by other forms, such as
 @rhombus(.) and @rhombus(#{#%ref}), for changing mutable components of
 some values.

@(
  examples:
    def mutable count: 0
    count := count + 1
    count
)
