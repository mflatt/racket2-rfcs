 Iterates as determined by @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clauses among the
 @rhombus(clause_or_body)s. An @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clause forms one layer
 of iteration; each subsequent part of the body is evaluated once per
 iteration, and additional @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) groups form nested
 iterations.

 The block after a binding within an @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clause must produce
 a @tech{sequence}. Each element of that sequence is bound in turn to
 the @rhombus(binding) variables of the @rhombus(each, ~for_clause). If a sequence
 can has multiple values as its elements (for example, a map as a
 sequence has a key and value for each element), then
 @rhombus(binding) can be a @rhombus(values, ~bind) pattern or just a
 prenthesized sequence of bindings to receive a matcging number of
 element values.

 An @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) followed immediately by a sequence binding is
 equivalent to @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) followed immediately by a block that
 contains the sequence binding. When multiple sequences are used in
 one iteration layer (i.e., in a block immediately after
 @rhombus(each, ~for_clause)), iteration stops as soon as one of the sequences in
 the layer is exhausted.

 A @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause) or @rhombus(skip_when, ~for_clause) clause short-circuits one
 iteration of the @rhombus(for) body, skipping remining expressions
 (including nested iterations) when the subsequent @rhombus(expr)
 produces @rhombus(#false) for @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause) or a true value for
 @rhombus(skip_when, ~for_clause). A @rhombus(break_when, ~for_clause) clause short-circuits the current
 iteration and all would-be remaining iterations of the @rhombus(for)
 form when its @rhombus(expr) produces a true value. A @rhombus(final_when, ~for_clause)
 clause is similar to @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause), but it allows one iteration to
 complete before skipping the reminaing iterations.

 New @rhombus(for) clause forms can be defined as macros that
 (eventually) expand to the core forms that are recognized by
 @rhombus(for).

 If a @rhombus(reducer) is specified, either before the block or at the
 end with @rhombus(~into), it determines how each result of the last
 @rhombus(body) is combined to produce a result of the overall
 @rhombus(for) expression, otherwise the result of the last
 @rhombus(body) is ignored and the @rhombus(for) expression's value is
 @rhombus(#void). Example reducers include @rhombus(List, ~reducer),
 @rhombus(Map, ~reducer), and @rhombus(values, ~reducer).

 If @rhombus(n_expr) produces an integer @rhombus(n, ~var) and
 @rhombus(m_expr) (when supplied) produces an integer @rhombus(m, ~var),
 returns a sequence containing the integers from @rhombus(n, ~var)
 (inclusive) to @rhombus(m, ~var) (exclusive). If @rhombus(m_expr) is not
 specified, the result is an infinite sequence that contains all integers
 starting from @rhombus(n, ~var).

 The @rhombus(..)'s precedence is lower than the arithmetic operators
 @rhombus(+), @rhombus(-), @rhombus(*), and @rhombus(/). In particular,
 @rhombus(n_expr..1+m_expr) creates a sequence that includes
 @rhombus(m, ~var) for many forms @rhombus(m_expr).
