@title(~tag: "map"){Maps}

The @rhombus(Map) constructor creates an immutable mapping of arbitrary
keys to values. The term @deftech{map} is meant to be generic, and
@rhombus(Map) as a constructor just uses a default implementation of
maps. The @rhombus(Map) constructor can be used like a function, in
which case it accepts keys paired with values in two-item lists:

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def neighborhood = Map(["alice", Posn(4, 5)],
                             ["bob", Posn(7, 9)])
    ~repl:
      neighborhood["alice"]
      ~error: neighborhood["clara"]
)

Curly braces @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") can be used as a shorthand
for writing @rhombus(Map($$(@elem{...}))). Within curly braces, the key and value
are joined by @litchar{:}. (If a key expression needs to use @litchar{:}
itself, the expression will have to be in parentheses.)

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def neighborhood = {"alice": Posn(4, 5),
                          "bob": Posn(7, 9)}
    ~repl:
      neighborhood["alice"]
)

You can also put @rhombus(Map) in from of
@litchar("{")...@litchar("}"), but that makes more sense with map
constructors other than the @rhombus(Map) default.

To functionally extend a map, use the @rhombus(++) append operator:

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def new_neighborhood: neighborhood ++ {"alice": Posn(40, 50)}
    ~repl:
      new_neighborhood["alice"]
      neighborhood["alice"]
)

When @rhombus(++) is used with a left-hand side that is statically known
to be the default implementation of maps, and when the right-hand
argument is an immediate map construction with a single element, then
the use of @rhombus(++) is compiled as an efficient single-key update of
the map. Whether optimized or general, the @rhombus(++) operator will
only combine certain compatible kinds of maps. For example, @rhombus(++)
will append lists and combine default-implementation maps, but it will
not combine two vectors or combine a list and a default-implementation
map with keys and values.

@rhombus(Map) or its curly-braces shorthand is also an annotation and a
binding constructor. As an annotation or binding constructor,
@rhombus(Map) refers to map values genercially, and not to a specific
implementation. For example, a list can be passed to a function that
expects a @rhombus(Map) argument.

In a binding use of @rhombus(Map), the key positions are @emph{expressions},
not @emph{bindings}. The binding matches an input that includes the keys, and
each corresponding value is matched to the value binding pattern.

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      fun alice_home({"alice": p}): p
    ~repl:
      alice_home(neighborhood)
)

The @rhombus(Map.of) annotation constructor takes two annotations, one
for keys and one for values:

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      fun locale(who, neighborhood -: Map.of(String, Posn)):
        def p = neighborhood[who]
        p.x +& ", " +& p.y
    ~repl:
      locale("alice", neighborhood)
)

Unlike @rhombus(.), indexed access via @litchar{[}...@litchar{]} works
even without static information to say that the access will succeed.
Still, static information can select a more specific and potentially
fast indexing operator. For example, @rhombus(buckets[0]) above
statically resolves to the use of array lookup, instead of going through
a generic function for maps at run time.

The @rhombus(MutableMap) constructor works similarly to the @rhombus(Map)
constructor, but it creates a mutable map. A mutable map can be updated
using @litchar{[}...@litchar{]} with @rhombus(:=) just like an array.

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def locations = MutableMap{"alice": Posn(4, 5),
                                 "bob": Posn(7, 9)}
    ~repl:
      locations["alice"] := Posn(40, 50)
      locations["alice"]
)

In a map @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") pattern, a @rhombus(&) form binds
to map for the ``rest'' of the map, analogous to the way @rhombus(&)
binds with lists. In a map @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") expression,
@rhombus(&) splices in the content of another map, similar to the way
@rhombus(&) works for list construction.

@(
  demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def {"bob": bob_home, & others} = neighborhood
    ~repl:
      others
      {& others, "clara": Posn(8, 2)}
)

Map patterns can also bind repetitions, and map constructions can use
repetitions. These repeition constructions tend to go through
intermediate lists, and so they tend to be less efficient than using
@rhombus(&) to work with maps, but they are especially useful when the
intent is to convert between lists and maps.

Before @rhombus(...) in a map construction, supply one repeition for
keys before @rhombus(:), and supply another repetition for values. The
repetitions must have the same length.

@(
  demo:
    ~defn:
      def [key, ...] = ["a", "b", "c"]
      def [val, ...] = [1, 2, 3]
    ~repl:
      {key: val, ...}
)

In a map pattern, @rhombus(:)-separated key and value bindings should
appear before @rhombus(...). Unlike key expressions for individual keys,
the key part of a repetition binding is a binding. There is no
guaranteed about the order of the keys and values, except that those two
repetitions use the same order (i.e., keys with associated values in
parallel).

@(
  demo:
    ~defn:
      def {key: val, ...} = {"b": 2, "a": 1, "c": 3}
    ~repl:
      [key, ...]
      [val, ...]
)
