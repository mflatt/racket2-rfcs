@title(~tag: "map"){Arrays and Maps}

The @rhombus(Array) constructor is similar to @rhombus(List), but it
creates an array, which has a fixed length at the time that itâ€™s created
and offers constant-time access to any element of the array. Like a
list, and array is a map. Unlike a list, an array is mutable, so
@litchar{[}...@litchar{]} for indexing can be combined with @rhombus(:=)
for assignment.

@(demo:
    ~defn:
      def buckets: Array(1, 2, 3, 4)
    ~repl:
      buckets[0]
      buckets[1] := 5
      buckets
  )

@rhombus(Array) is also an annotation and a binding contructor,
analogous to @rhombus(List), and @rhombus(Array.of) is an annotation
constructor. The @rhombus(Array, ~bind) binding form does not support
@rhombus(..., ~bind) or @rhombus(&, ~bind), but the @rhombus(Array)
constructor supports @rhombus(..., ~bind) and @rhombus(&, ~bind).

The @rhombus(Map) constructor creates an immutable mapping of arbitrary
keys to values. The term @deftech{map} is meant to be generic, and
@rhombus(Map) as a constructor just uses a default implementation of
maps. The @rhombus(Map) constructor can be used like a function, in
which case it accepts keys paired with values in two-item lists:

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def neighborhood: Map(["alice", Posn(4, 5)],
                            ["bob", Posn(7, 9)])
    ~repl:
      neighborhood["alice"]
      ~error: neighborhood["clara"]
  )

Curly braces @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") can be used as a shorthand
for writing @rhombus(Map($$(@elem{...}))). Within curly braces, the key and value
are joined by @litchar{:}. (If a key expression needs to use @litchar{:}
itself, the expression will have to be in parentheses.)

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def neighborhood: {"alice": Posn(4, 5),
                         "bob": Posn(7, 9)}
    ~repl:
      neighborhood["alice"]
  )

You can also put @rhombus(Map) in from of
@litchar("{")...@litchar("}"), but that makes more sense with map
constructors other than the @rhombus(Map) default.

To functionally extend a map, use the @rhombus(++) append operator:

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def new_neighborhood: neighborhood ++ {"alice": Posn(40, 50)}
    ~repl:
      new_neighborhood["alice"]
      neighborhood["alice"]
  )

When @rhombus(++) is used with a left-hand side that is statically known
to be the default implementation of maps, and when the right-hand
argument is an immediate map construction with a single element, then
the use of @rhombus(++) is compiled as an efficient single-key update of
the map. Whether optimized or general, the @rhombus(++) operator will
only combine certain compatible kinds of maps. For example, @rhombus(++)
will append lists and combine default-implementation maps, but it will
not combine two vectors or combine a list and a default-implementation
map with keys and values.

@rhombus(Map) or its curly-braces shorthand is also an annotation and a
binding constructor. As an annotation or binding constructor,
@rhombus(Map) refers to map values genercially, and not to a specific
implementation. For example, a list can be passed to a function that
expects a @rhombus(Map) argument.

In a binding use of @rhombus(Map), the key positions are @emph{expressions},
not @emph{bindings}. The binding matches an input that includes the keys, and
each corresponding value is matched to the value binding pattern.

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      fun alice_home({"alice": p}): p
    ~repl:
      alice_home(neighborhood)
  )

The @rhombus(Map.of) annotation constructor takes two annotations, one
for keys and one for values:

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      fun locale(who, neighborhood -: Map.of(String, Posn)):
        def p: neighborhood[who]
        p.x +& ", " +& p.y
    ~repl:
      locale("alice", neighborhood)
  )

Unlike @rhombus(.), indexed access via @litchar{[}...@litchar{]} works
even without static information to say that the access will succeed.
Still, static information can select a more specific and potentially
fast indexing operator. For example, @rhombus(buckets[0]) above
statically resolves to the use of array lookup, instead of going through
a generic function for maps at run time.

The @rhombus(MutableMap) constructor works similarly to the @rhombus(Map)
constructor, but it creates a mutable map. A mutable map can be updated
using @litchar{[}...@litchar{]} with @rhombus(:=) just like an array.

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def locations: MutableMap{"alice": Posn(4, 5),
                                "bob": Posn(7, 9)}
    ~repl:
      locations["alice"] := Posn(40, 50)
      locations["alice"]
  )

In a map @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") pattern, a @rhombus(&) form binds
to map for the ``rest'' of the map, analogous to the way @rhombus(&)
binds with lists. In a map @litchar("{")...@litchar("}") expression,
@rhombus(&) splices in the content of another map, similar to the way
@rhombus(&) works for list construction.

@(demo:
    ~eval: map_eval
    ~defn:
      def {"bob": bob_home, & others}: neighborhood
    ~repl:
      others
      {& others, "clara": Posn(8, 2)}
  )
