 Defines @rhombus(defined_name) as a macro
 in the @rhombus(expr, ~space) @tech{space}. The macro can be used
 in a definition context, where the compile-time
 @rhombus(body) block returns the expansion result. The macro pattern is
 matched to an entire group in a definition context.

 The expansion result must be a sequence of groups that are inlined in
 place of the definition-macro use.

 The @rhombus(option)s in the macro body must be distinct; since there
 is only one option currently, either the @rhombus(~op_stx) option is
 present or not. The @rhombus(~op_stx) option, if present, binds an
 identifier for a use of the macro (which cannot be matched directly in
 the @rhombus(pattern), since that position is used for the name
 that @rhombus(defn.macro) binds).

 Using @vbar alternatives, a single definition can have any number of
 @rhombus(pattern)s, which are tried in order. The @rhombus(defined_name)
 must be the same across all cases.

 See also @rhombus(expr.merge).

){

 Similar to @rhombus(defn.macro, ~expr), but defines a macro for a definition
 context that is matched against all of the remaining groups in the
 context, so the pattern is a multi-group pattern.

 The macro result is two values: a sequence of groups to
 splice in place of the sequence-macro use, and a sequence of
 groups that represent the tail of the definition context that was not consumed.

@examples(
  ~eval: macro_eval
  defn.sequence_macro 'reverse_defns
                       $defn1
                       $defn2

    values('$defn2; $defn1', '$tail; ...')

@doc(
  syntax_class defn_meta.Group:
    kind: ~group
){

 @provided_meta()

 Syntax class that matches only groups that start with an identifier
 that is bound as a definition form.

 Unlike @rhombus(expr_meta.Parsed), @rhombus(defn_meta.Group) does not
 parse the definition form, because the form normally needs to be parsed
 within a definition context. This syntax class can be used to
 distinguish definitions from other forms that need to be treated
 differently in some context.

@doc(
  syntax_class defn_meta.SequenceStartGroup:
    kind: ~group
){

 @provided_meta()

 Syntax class that matches only groups that starts with an identifier
 that is bound as a definition-sequence form.

}


@doc(
  fun defn_meta.pack_s_exp(tree) :: Syntax
){

@provided_meta()

 Similar to @rhombus(expr_meta.pack_s_exp), but for definitions.
