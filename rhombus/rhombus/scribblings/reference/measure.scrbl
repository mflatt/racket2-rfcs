  grammar option:
    ~gc
){

 Returns the same value(s) as the @rhombus(body) sequence, but first
 prints to the current output port the amount of time elapsed during the
 evaluation of @rhombus(body) sequence.

 If the @rhombus(~gc) option is specified, then @rhombus(memory.gc) is
 called before the @rhombus(body) sequence, and time required for the
 garbage collection is not counted as part of the reported time.

@examples(
  import rhombus/measure
  measure.time:
    for all:
      each i: 0..10000000
      "useless"
)

}

@doc(
  expr.macro 'measure.memory:
                $body
                ...'
){

 Returns the same value(s) as the @rhombus(body) sequence, but first
 prints to the current output port information about allocation during
 the evaluation of @rhombus(body) sequence.

@examples(
  import rhombus/measure
  measure.memory:
    for all:
      each i: 0..10
      [1, 2]
)

 Combines @rhombus(measure.time) and @rhombus(measure.memory).
