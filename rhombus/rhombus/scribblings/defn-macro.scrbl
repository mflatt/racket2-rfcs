@title(~tag: "defn-macro"){Definition and Declaration Macros}

The @rhombus(defn.macro) form defines a definition macro. It is similar
to @rhombus(expr.macro) in prefix form, except that the name must be an
identifier (never an operator), and the result syntax object should
represent a block, which is spliced into the definition context where
the macro is used.

Hereâ€™s the classic @rhombus(def_five) macro:

@examples(
  ~eval: macro_eval
  ~defn:
    import:
      rhombus/meta open

    defn.macro 'def_five $id':
      'def $id = 5'
  ~repl:
    def_five v
    v
)

Declarations macros are written with @rhombus(decl.macro), and the
block produced by expansion can use forms like @rhombus(import) and
@rhombus(export).

By distinguishing between expression macros, definition macros, and
declaration macros, Rhombus can report errors for out-of-place uses
earlier and more clearly than Racket.
