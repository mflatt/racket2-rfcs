){

 Defines @rhombus(id) to provide an absolute path that refers to the
 file name produced by the @rhombus(body) sequence as interpreted
 relative to the source module.

 An unutual property of @rhombus(runtime_path.def) is that the
 @rhombus(body) sequence is used in both a run-time context and a
 @rhombus(meta) context, so it must be valid for both. The meta
 interpretation is used for tasks like creating a standalone executable
 to ensure that referenced files are accessible at run time.

@examples(
  import:
    rhombus/meta open
    rhombus/runtime_path
  runtime_path.def image_file: "file.png"
)

}
