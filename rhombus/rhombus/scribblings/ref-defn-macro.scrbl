 The @tech{space} for bindings of identifiers that can be used in

@provided_meta()

 A compile-time value that identifies the same space as
 @rhombus(defn, ~space). See also @rhombus(SpaceMeta, ~annot).

 Defines @rhombus(defined_name) as a macro
 in the @rhombus(expr, ~space) @tech{space}. The macro can be used
 in a definition context, where the compile-time
 @rhombus(body) block returns the expansion result. The macro pattern is
 matched to an entire group in a definition context.

 The expansion result must be a sequence of groups that are inlined in
 place of the definition-macro use.

 The @rhombus(option)s in the macro body must be distinct. The
 @rhombus(~op_stx) option, if present, binds an identifier for a use
 of the macro (which cannot be matched directly in the
 @rhombus(pattern), since that position is used for the name that
 @rhombus(defn.macro) binds). The @rhombus(~all_stx) option binds an
 identifier to the input that is matched by the
 @rhombus(prefix_macro_pattern), which includes the identifier or
 operator that @rhombus(~op_stx) would capture.

 Using @vbar alternatives, a single definition can have any number of
 @rhombus(pattern)s, which are tried in order. The @rhombus(defined_name)
 must be the same across all cases.

){

 Similar to @rhombus(defn.macro), but defines a macro for a definition
 context that is matched against all of the remaining groups in the
 context, so the pattern is a multi-group pattern.

 The macro result is two values: a sequence of groups to
 splice in place of the sequence-macro use, and a sequence of
 groups that represent the tail of the definition context that was not consumed.

@examples(
  ~eval: macro_eval
  defn.sequence_macro 'reverse_defns
                       $defn1
                       $defn2
                       $tail
                       ...':
    values('$defn2; $defn1', '$tail; ...')

@doc(
  syntax_class defn_meta.Group:
    kind: ~group
){

 @provided_meta()

 Syntax class that matches only groups that start with an identifier
 that is bound as a definition form.

 Unlike @rhombus(expr_meta.Parsed, ~stxclass), @rhombus(defn_meta.Group, ~stxclass) does not
 parse the definition form, because the form normally needs to be parsed
 within a definition context. This syntax class can be used to
 distinguish definitions from other forms that need to be treated
 differently in some context.

}

@doc(
  syntax_class defn_meta.SequenceStartGroup:
    kind: ~group
){

 @provided_meta()

 Syntax class that matches only groups that starts with an identifier
 that is bound as a definition-sequence form.

}


@doc(
  fun defn_meta.pack_s_exp(tree :: Any) :: Syntax
){

@provided_meta()

 Similar to @rhombus(expr_meta.pack_s_exp), but for definitions.
