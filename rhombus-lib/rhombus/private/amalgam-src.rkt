;; This is the only module outside the "amalgam" directory that is
;; allowed to refer to modules in that directory. All other references
;; to that code need to go through the "amalgam.rkt" module and its
;; submodules, which (roughly) has a copy all of the "amalgam" modules
;; in one big module with big submodules.

;; Some modules here, such as `core` versus `core-macro`, represent
;; different sets of modules that might be loaded and instantiated
;; without other modules. The flattened form "amalgam.rkt" keeps those
;; entry points as separate submodules, so the separateness of loading
;; and instantiating the dependent modules is preserved. Those
;; different sets may overlap, and the demodularizer figures out how
;; to organize the dependent modules into submodules so that modules
;; are compiled together as much as possible, but no module is
;; duplicated when it is reachable from different entry points and
;; potentially at different phases.
